    "Write on the blackboard while teaching. The two visible areas are: " +
    "- 'middle' (large formal French area): definitions, objectives, exam steps, formulas, diagrams and final answers. " +
    "- 'right' (examples in Moroccan Darija): EXAMPLES ONLY. It accepts nothing but type='example' with a title and a concrete worked Darija situation. SPEECH-SYNCED: the board holds the write until your own voice has actually spoken that example, then draws it — so you MUST say the example out loud right after calling this, in the same turn. If you never say it, it never appears. Never paste your spoken explanation, questions, greetings, comments or lesson steps here — those belong in zone='middle' or stay spoken. Invalid writes are rejected. " +
    "SEMANTIC TYPES + STRICT VISUAL POLICY: " +
    "heading = lesson title, YELLOW and underlined, never boxed. " +
    "objective = bullet/numbered lesson goals, WHITE and unboxed. " +
    "definition = French term plus formal French definition; supply 'term' and 'content'. Both are white except the term is yellow. Automatically boxed, no colored paragraph. " +
    "formula/latex = exact exam notation in raw LaTeX, WHITE and UNBOXED by default (worked steps, substitutions, example values). Set boxed=true ONLY for the single essential formula of the current point that students must memorize — at most one boxed formula per point. Optionally set accentSymbols to the single variable(s) students commonly confuse; ONLY those symbols are rendered red. Do not color the whole formula. " +
    "example = label 'Exemple de … :' in yellow, Darija example in white, never boxed. " +
    "question = a question you are asking the STUDENT right now: the whole question is written in BLUE chalk (its own reserved colour) with a 'Question :' label and a dashed rule, never boxed. ALWAYS write it here at the exact moment you ask it out loud, in zone='middle'. Write it ONLY in short, simple French (one short sentence, everyday words, no Arabic; math in $...$) even though you ask it aloud in Darija — e.g. 'Quelle est la partie réelle de $z = 3 + 2i$ ?'. It never erases anything on the board; it only replaces a previous pending question (one at a time). " +
    "takeaway = final answer/main takeaway, RED accent and automatically boxed. Red is reserved for final answers and specifically marked error-prone formula symbols only. If the takeaway IS an equation, write it as raw LaTeX exactly like a formula (e.g. (c)' = 0 as \\left(c\\right)' = 0) — never as plain characters; the board typesets it. " +
    "text and svg = white by default. Objectives use items as bullets. Leave color empty: the board enforces these semantic colors itself. " +
    "A question write NEVER erases anything: it only replaces a previous pending question. In NORMAL tutoring, when a zone is full the board does NOT erase itself and NOTHING is written: the tool answers board_full and you must ASK the student for permission to erase (in Darija), then STOP and wait. The learner erases the board themselves by pressing the «امسح وكمّل» button, which sends you 'continue' — only then call board_write again to resume the same point. DURING CONTINUOUS LECTURE MODE, the app wipes the full zone automatically; do not ask, wait for the wipe, resend the same write once, and keep teaching. Write in short, copyable chunks. " +
    "PACING (ENFORCED): emit ONE board_write, then speak 2-3 sentences about exactly that line before the next write — never fire several writes back-to-back (no example + question + explanation in one burst); the board reveals each line as you speak about it. After your first write in a response, further writes are REFUSED with status 'paced' until you have spoken about what is already on the board: when that happens, speak first, then resend. A turn that writes without ANY speech gets you a forced speak-now reminder. Never send the same content twice: a 'duplicate' response means it is already there, so move on.",

    "PROACTIVE TEACHING TOOL — use it yourself, never wait for the student to ask, but use it ONLY where a mark changes what the student understands in the sentence you are saying right now. " +
    "TIMING: call it at the moment you speak about that exact symbol, so the mark appears as its meaning is heard. " +
    "SMART USE: arrow (kind='arrow') a symbol to its meaning when you NAME it (e.g. in z = a + bi: 'a' -> 'partie réelle', 'bi' -> 'partie imaginaire'; in E_c = 1/2 m v^2: 'm' -> 'masse', 'v' -> 'vitesse'); circle (kind='circle') ONE easy-to-miss detail as you say it (a minus sign, a small exponent, a subscript, a unit). Skip symbols you are not naming this turn — marks are teaching, not decoration. Max 2-3 marks per block; older marks expire when you move on. " +
    "WHEN TO CIRCLE (use freely and proactively): a single word/symbol/subscript students often misread (a minus sign, a small exponent, a silent letter) so it cannot be skipped; flagging 'pay attention here' in the middle of a line or equation without breaking flow the way a full box would; marking what the student just said (in the right zone) to show 'this is the point we build on', without rewriting it. Circle is for ONE small detail inside something bigger — it is NOT the same as boxed=true on board_write, which marks a whole formula/definition/answer as the final important unit (used once per concept). Clear a circle (kind='clear') once its point has been made if it is no longer needed. " +
    "WHEN TO ARROW: to show what a symbol or piece of a formula MEANS (target inside one block, e.g. the 'a' in z = a + bi is the 'partie réelle') — use this tool for that proactively! To show a SEQUENCE/FLOW between two different blocks (step 1 → step 2, cause → effect) or to point back to a rule/formula written earlier so the student sees why a step is valid, use board_connect instead (it links two blocks, not one). " +
    "AVOID ARROWS when two things are already next to each other on the board — proximity already shows the link. Keep at most 3 arrows on the whole board at once (board_annotate arrows + board_connect together). " +
    "Example, for the formula z = a + bi (write it first with board_write): call kind='arrow', target='a', label='partie réelle', side='below'; then kind='arrow', target='bi', label='partie imaginaire', side='above'. " +
    "Kinds: 'arrow' = arrow pointing at the target with the label written at its tail; 'circle' = confident double-loop drawn around the target (an optional label adds an arrow); 'underline' = underline with an optional label — good for 'pay attention' without a full circle; 'clear' = remove all annotations of that block. " +
    "TARGETS INSIDE A PROOF / MULTI-STEP DERIVATION: write each step as its OWN type='formula' block (raw LaTeX, e.g. content='a) \\; |z|^2 = z\\\\bar{z} = (a+ib)(a-ib)'), then annotate THAT block. Never put proof steps inside a type='text' block — the steps get split into fragments and the marks land in the wrong place. " +
    "target = the exact VISIBLE characters as displayed (for z = a + bi: 'a', 'bi', '=' or 'z'); no LaTeX commands, write Greek letters as α β θ…; use occurrence=2 for the second match. " +
    "TARGETING A SYMBOL SAFELY: a bare letter like 'a' also occurs inside French words, so before marking the parts of an equation, write that equation as its OWN block — board_write(zone='middle', type='formula', content='z = a + ib') — and mark that block. If the equation only exists inside a sentence, pass within='z = a + ib' together with target='a'. Ambiguous single letters are rejected. " +
    "label = 1-3 simple French words, NEVER Arabic. Use opposite sides (above/below) for neighbouring targets so labels do not collide (the board alternates them for you if you omit side). At most 4 annotations per block, and annotate only the part you are explaining now. " +
